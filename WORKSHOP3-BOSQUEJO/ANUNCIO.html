               <font size=3 face ="times new roman">Spinal Descompression has become the most advanced non-surgical tool aimed at treating
                    arm, leg, neck and back pain associated with disc hemiations and degeneration.</br></br>In January 2002,
                    Dr. Caruso was among the first chiropractors to introduce this breakthrough
                    technology to Westchester Country. Since then, Dr. Caruso's Scarsdale, NY based facility,
                    Spine Care, has established a unique precedent with the success of pre and post MRI scans.
                    His impressive results have now inspired a large network of referring physicians and 
                    chiropractors (throughout Westchester Country and Manhattan) who work closely with Dr.
                    Caruso.</font></br></br></br>
